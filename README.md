# jQuery Emoji Picker #

## Description ##

The top 3 things your users love:

1. Animated GIFs
2. Emojis
3. üç©'s

This JQuery Plugin allows you to add support for both Emojis and üç© to any text input on your web app.  With this plugin, your desktop users can enjoy the same great Emoji support your mobile users already have. All while eating a üç©.

## Installation ##

Make sure that jQuery is included in your `<head></head>` tag:

	<script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery-1.11.2.min.js"></script>

Add the following to your `<head></head>` tag:

	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/emojipicker.css">
	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/wemoji-apple.css">
	<script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery.emojipicker.js"></script>

The jQuery Emoji Picker has 3 icon sets to choose from - Apple, Twitter, and Google icons. The Apple icons are used by default. To instead use Twitter or Google icons, replace:

	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/wemoji-apple.css">

with either Google:

	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/wemoji-google.css">

or Twitter:

	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/wemoji-twitter.css">

Initialize the jQuery Emoji Picker by calling `emojiPicker` on an input element with optional parameters, described below:

	  height: '300px',
	  width: '450px'
	});
